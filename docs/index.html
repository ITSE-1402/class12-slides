</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

The material we have covered in this class so far is fundamentals you need to know to get coding just about anything you wish to in Python.

<aside class="notes"><p>Obviously this is said a little tongue in cheek, but it&#39;s a rather true statement.  We simply can&#39;t talk about every module.. even those included in the built-in library. We can&#39;t discuss every exception. We can&#39;t hit every single concept that you might use in python. Not only because you&#39;ll get buried in information, but also because you won&#39;t learn it.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Now we will talk about some alternative ways to do things and in some cases some more pythonic.

<aside class="notes"><p>The author of our book realizes this and has saved some material toward the end to avoid overwhelming you. Obviously even with this chapter, you still won&#39;t know everything. Practice, Google, and reading documentation makes perfect. We still have 2 more classes to go, but it&#39;s a good time to talk about it. When you leave this class don&#39;t stop coding. If python is something you are serious in learning, don&#39;t stop learning when you leave the class. If you just don&#39;t do anything with the knowledge you&#39;ve gotten when you leave the class, you will lose it and it will happen more quickly than you might think. This is, in part, why I encourage you to do codefights. This simple site gives you an exercise you can do nearly every day and you should do them, if nothing else, to keep sharp on the concepts. A man smarter than I that does more coding than I recommended this site to me and told me to make sure I code at least once a day even if it&#39;s just for a few minutes. I&#39;ll be the first to admit I don&#39;t do this, but it doesn&#39;t make it any less true.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

##### 19.1 Conditional expressions

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

We saw conditional statements in Section 5.4. Conditional statements are often used to choose one of two values:

```python
if x > 0:
    y = math.log(x)
else:
    y = float('nan')
```

<aside class="notes"><p>This statement checks whether x is positive. If so, it computes math.log. If not, math.log would raise a ValueError. To avoid stopping the program, we generate a “NaN”, which is a special floating-point value that represents “Not a Number”.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

We can write this statement more concisely using a conditional expression:

```python
y = math.log(x) if x > 0 else float('nan')
```

<aside class="notes"><p>You can almost read this line like English: “y gets log-x if x is greater than 0; otherwise it gets NaN”.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Recursive functions can sometimes be rewritten using conditional expressions. Here is a recursive version of factorial:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

We can rewrite it like this:

```python
def factorial(n):
    return 1 if n == 0 else n * factorial(n-1)
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Another use of conditional expressions is handling optional arguments. For example, here is the init method from GoodKangaroo:

```python
def __init__(self, name, contents=None):
  	self.name = name
  	if contents == None:
    		contents = []
  	self.pouch_contents = contents
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

We can rewrite this one like this:

```python
def __init__(self, name, contents=None):
    self.name = name
    self.pouch_contents = [] if contents == None else contents 
```

<aside class="notes"><p>In general, you can replace a conditional statement with a conditional expression if both branches contain simple expressions that are either returned or assigned to the same variable.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

##### 19.2 List comprehensions

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

In Section 10.7 we saw the map and filter patterns. 

```python
def capitalize_all(t):
    res = []
    for s in t:
        res.append(s.capitalize())
    return res
```

<aside class="notes"><p>For example, this function takes a list of strings, maps the string method capitalize to the elements, and returns a new list of strings.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

We can write this more concisely using a list comprehension:

```python
def capitalize_all(t):
    return [s.capitalize() for s in t]
```

<aside class="notes"><p>The bracket operators indicate that we are constructing a new list. The expression inside the brackets specifies the elements of the list, and the for clause indicates what sequence we are traversing.
The syntax of a list comprehension is a little awkward because the loop variable, s in this example, appears in the expression before we get to the definition.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

List comprehensions can also be used for filtering.

```python
def only_upper(t):
    res = []
    for s in t:
        if s.isupper():
            res.append(s)
    return res
```

<aside class="notes"><p>For example, this function selects only the elements of t that are upper case, and returns a new list.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

```python
def only_upper(t):
    return [s for s in t if s.isupper()]
```

<aside class="notes"><p>List comprehensions are concise and easy to read, at least for simple expressions. And they are usually faster than the equivalent for loops, sometimes much faster.
List comprehensions are harder to debug because you can’t put a print statement inside the loop. You should only use them if the computation is simple enough that you are likely to get it right the first time.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

##### 19.3 Generator expressions

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">    
    
We can rewrite it using a list comprehension

```python
g = (x**2 for x in range(5))
# <generator object <genexpr> at 0x7f4c45a786c0>
next(g)    # 0
next(g)    # 1

for val in g:
	print(val)

# 4
# 9
# 16
```

<aside class="notes"><p>Generator expressions are similar to list comprehensions, but with parentheses instead of square brackets.
The result is a generator object that knows how to iterate through a sequence of values. But unlike a list comprehension, it does not compute the values all at once; it waits to be asked. The built-in function next gets the next value from the generator.
When you get to the end of the sequence, next raises a StopIteration exception. You can also use a for loop to iterate through the values.
The generator object keeps track of where it is in the sequence, so the for loop picks up where next left off.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Generator expressions are often used with functions like sum, max, and min:

```python
sum(x**2 for x in range(5))
30
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

##### 19.4 any and all

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Python provides a built-in function, any, that takes a sequence of boolean values and returns True if any of the values are True. It works on lists:

```python
any([False, False, True])   # True
```

But it is often used with generator expressions:
```python
any(letter == 't' for letter in 'monty')  # True
```

<aside class="notes"><p>That example isn’t very useful because it does the same thing as the in operator.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

We could use any to rewrite some of the search functions we wrote in Section 9.3. For example, we could write avoids like this:

```python
def avoids(word, forbidden):
    return not any(letter in forbidden for letter in word)
```

<aside class="notes"><p>The function almost reads like English, “word avoids forbidden if there are not any forbidden letters in word.”
Using any with a generator expression is efficient because it stops immediately if it finds a True value, so it doesn’t have to evaluate the whole sequence.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Python provides another built-in function that works just like any, all, and returns True if every element of the sequence is True.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

##### 19.5 Sets

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Previously we used dictionaries to find the words that appear in a document but not in a word list.

```python
def subtract(d1, d2):
    res = dict()
    for key in d1:
        if key not in d2:
            res[key] = None
    return res
```

<aside class="notes"><p>The function written takes d1, which contains the words from the document as keys, and d2, which contains the list of words. It returns a dictionary that contains the keys from d1 that are not in d2.
In all of these dictionaries, the values are None because we never use them. As a result, we waste some storage space.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Python provides another built-in type, called a set, that behaves like a collection of dictionary keys with no values. Adding elements to a set is fast; so is checking membership. And sets provide methods and operators to compute common set operations.

```python
def subtract(d1, d2):
    return set(d1) - set(d2)
```

<aside class="notes"><p>For example, set subtraction is available as a method called difference or as an operator, -. So we can rewrite subtract like this. 
The result is a set instead of a dictionary, but for operations like iteration, the behavior is the same.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Some of the exercises in this book can be done concisely and efficiently with sets. For example, here is a solution to has_duplicates, from Exercise 7, that uses a dictionary:

```python
def has_duplicates(t):
    d = {}
    for x in t:
        if x in d:
            return True
        d[x] = True
    return False
```

<aside class="notes"><p>When an element appears for the first time, it is added to the dictionary. If the same element appears again, the function returns True.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Using sets, we can write the same function like this:

```python
def has_duplicates(t):
    return len(set(t)) < len(t)
```

<aside class="notes"><p>An element can only appear in a set once, so if an element in t appears more than once, the set will be smaller than t. If there are no duplicates, the set will be the same size as t.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

We can also use sets to do some of the exercises in Chapter 9. For example, here’s a version of uses_only with a loop:

```python
def uses_only(word, available):
    for letter in word: 
        if letter not in available:
            return False
    return True
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

uses_only checks whether all letters in word are in available. We can rewrite it like this:

```python
def uses_only(word, available):
    return set(word) <= set(available)
```

<aside class="notes"><p>The &lt;= operator checks whether one set is a subset or another, including the possibility that they are equal, which is true if all the letters in word appear in available.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

##### 19.6 Counters

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

A Counter is like a set, except that if an element appears more than once, the Counter keeps track of how many times it appears.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Counter is defined in a standard module called collections, so you have to import it. You can initialize a Counter with a string, list, or anything else that supports iteration:

```python
from collections import Counter
count = Counter('parrot')
# Counter({'r': 2, 't': 1, 'o': 1, 'p': 1, 'a': 1})
count['d']
# 0
```

<aside class="notes"><p>Counters behave like dictionaries in many ways; they map from each key to the number of times it appears. As in dictionaries, the keys have to be hashable.
Unlike dictionaries, Counters don’t raise an exception if you access an element that doesn’t appear. Instead, they return 0:</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

We can use Counters to rewrite is_anagram from Exercise 6:

```python
def is_anagram(word1, word2):
    return Counter(word1) == Counter(word2)
```

<aside class="notes"><p>If two words are anagrams, they contain the same letters with the same counts, so their Counters are equivalent.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Counters provide methods and operators to perform set-like operations, including addition, subtraction, union and intersection.

```python`
count = Counter('parrot')
for val, freq in count.most_common(3):
    print(val, freq)
# r 2
# p 1
# a 1
```

<aside class="notes"><p>As seen here, they also provide an often-useful method, most_common, which returns a list of value-frequency pairs, sorted from most common to least.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

##### 19.7 defaultdict

The collections module also provides defaultdict, which is like a dictionary except that if you access a key that doesn’t exist, it can generate a new value on the fly.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

When you create a defaultdict, you provide a function that’s used to create new values. The built-in functions that create lists, sets, and other types can be used as factories:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
d = defaultdict(list)
t = d['new key']
print(t)
[]
t.append('new value')
print(d)
defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'new key': ['new value']})
```

<aside class="notes"><p>A factory is a function that produces objects.
Notice that the argument is list, which is a class object, not list(), which is a new list. The function you provide doesn’t get called unless you access a key that doesn’t exist.
If you are making a dictionary of lists, you can often write simpler code using defaultdict.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

This is an example of code that can be made simpler with defaultdict:

```python
def all_anagrams(filename):
    d = {}
    for line in open(filename):
        word = line.strip().lower()
        t = signature(word)
        if t not in d:
            d[t] = [word]
        else:
            d[t].append(word)
    return d
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

This can be simplified using setdefault, which you might have used before:

```python
def all_anagrams(filename):
    d = {}
    for line in open(filename):
        word = line.strip().lower()
        t = signature(word)
        d.setdefault(t, []).append(word)
    return d
```

<aside class="notes"><p>This solution has the drawback that it makes a new list every time, regardless of whether it is needed. For lists, that’s no big deal, but if the factory function is complicated, it might be.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

We can avoid this problem and simplify the code using a defaultdict:

```python
def all_anagrams(filename):
    d = defaultdict(list)
    for line in open(filename):
        word = line.strip().lower()
        t = signature(word)
        d[t].append(word)
    return d
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

##### 19.8 Named tuples

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Many simple objects are basically collections of related values. For example, the Point object defined in Chapter 15 contains two numbers, x and y. 

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

When you define a class like this, you usually start with an init method and a str method:

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __str__(self):
        return '(%g, %g)' % (self.x, self.y)
```

<aside class="notes"><p>This is a lot of code to convey a small amount of information.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Python provides a more concise way to say the same thing:

```python
from collections import namedtuple
Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
# <class '__main__.Point'>
```

<aside class="notes"><p>The first argument is the name of the class you want to create. The second is a list of the attributes Point objects should have, as strings. The return value from namedtuple is a class object.
Point automatically provides methods like __init__ and __str__ so you don’t have to write them.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"> 

To create a Point object, you use the Point class as a function:

```python
from collections import namedtuple
Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
p = Point(1, 2)
print(p)
# Point(x=1, y=2)
```

<aside class="notes"><p>The init method assigns the arguments to attributes using the names you provided. The str method prints a representation of the Point object and its attributes.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

You can access the elements of the named tuple by name or as a normal tuple.

```python
from collections import namedtuple
Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
p = Point(1, 2)
print((p.x, p.y))
# (1, 2)
print((p[0], p[1]))
# (1, 2)
x, y = p
print((x, y))
# (1, 2)
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Named tuples provide a quick way to define simple classes. The drawback is that simple classes don’t always stay simple. You might decide later that you want to add methods to a named tuple. In that case, you could define a new class that inherits from the named tuple:

```python
class Pointier(Point):
    # add more methods here
```

<aside class="notes"><p>Or you could switch to a conventional class definition.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

##### 19.9 Gathering keyword args

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

In Section 12.4, we saw how to write a function that gathers its arguments into a tuple:

```python
def printall(*args):
    print(args)
printall(1, 2.0, '3')
# (1, 2.0, '3')
printall(1, 2.0, third='3')
# TypeError: printall() got an unexpected keyword argument 'third'
```

<aside class="notes"><p>You can call this function with any number of positional arguments (that is, arguments that don’t have keywords):
But the * operator doesn’t gather keyword arguments.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

To gather keyword arguments, you can use the ** operator:

```python
def printall(*args, **kwargs):
    print(args, kwargs)
printall(1, 2.0, third='3')
# (1, 2.0) {'third': '3'}
```

You can call the keyword gathering parameter anything you want, but kwargs is a common choice. The result is a dictionary that maps keywords to values

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

If you have a dictionary of keywords and values, you can use the scatter operator, ** to call a function:

```python
d = dict(x=1, y=2)
Point(**d)
# Point(x=1, y=2)
d = dict(x=1, y=2)
Point(d)
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
# TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'y'
```

<aside class="notes"><p>Without the scatter operator, the function would treat d as a single positional argument, so it would assign d to x and complain because there’s nothing to assign to y.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

When you are working with functions that have a large number of parameters, it is often useful to create and pass around dictionaries that specify frequently used options.

##### Appendix A: Debugging

<aside class="notes"><p>You may have noticed that we skipped over the debugging section of each chapter. This was intentional.
First of all, you have the book and if you were having issues I&#39;d hope you look at it. Secondly, we have this whole section on debugging.. it&#39;s it&#39;s more of troubleshooting. Why not learn with examples?
Let&#39;s crack open our books and look back at the a few of the debugging sections. We won&#39;t actually look through either appendix, but feel free to take a look on your own time. The debugging chapter is mostly common sense and the Algorythm Analysis chapter is more than you need to know at this point.</p>
